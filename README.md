## Installation
1. `cd` to the main directory

2.  `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Notes 

1. Folder structure - I choose this folder structure because it scale for more components, I know it is overkill for small project but this is a good foundation.

2. The app is responsive for all 3 types of screens requested via media queries 

3. Future reducers will go in a `combainReducer` function 

4. Loading transition will appear while fetching the data.

5. I've used css-modules.
